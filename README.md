# Analytics-Assistance-Tool
An AI powered analytics assistance tool to help with basic EDA tasks based on user queries. 


How it works-

This is a tool hosted on Streamlit where the user can upload any dataset and ask questions related to it. 
For example, "Give the summary statistics for this data" or "Give the next three months forecast for this KPI". These are general EDA queries  but the user can also ask very specific questions which are of a complicated nature. 

All you need to do is to enter an API key (Gemini offers open sourced but limited tokens keys) and the respective model name. 

Dependencies Required-
User will need to have the relevant packages installed on their system like seaborn,plotly etc.
